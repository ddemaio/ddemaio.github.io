Tumbleweed Rolling Reliability Paradox - **"In order to change some things quickly while staying reliable, you must be able to change ALL things quickly."**

Enterprise Stability Rule - **"In order to preserve stability, you must change as little as possible."**

Unified Stability/Reliability Model - **"Changing software stacks while maintaining a static base system can only be achieved at either the cost of stability, reliability, or by accepting a measured pace or scope of change."**

Regular Release Rule/Leap Law - **"In order to find balance between stability, reliability, and pace of change, you must change little or nothing after a release. In new minor releases, small to moderate changes should be considered. Major change should be reserved for new major version releases."**

(Modules/PackageHub) Extensions Exception - **"Narrowly defined software stacks can move at a moderately faster pace, assuming they do not require change elsewhere in the operating system."**
