The topic of an increasing mobile market share and a decrease in personal/portable computer market share based on sales inclines and declines are largely a myth.

The topic has been around for years and some projects and companies have even transitioned strategies to embed into the growing mobile trend.

This behavior to grow with emerging technologies is normal for companies and projects even if the platform changes, but a recent article titled [“How Long Will Desktop Linux Last?”](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/how-long-will-desktop-linux-last.html) published May 11 made an outlandish statement that “we may be nearing time for a fond farewell to desktop Linux.”


### The statement is ridiculous and this is why.
The PC market is saturated and the PC has now become part of a cyclical industry; some years it will grow and some years it will decline. It’s easy to make a statement like mobile is replacing the PC when it's market is less than a decade old compared to a market of nearly twice that; mobile only has one direction and that is up until it peaks, which may not be that far away.

According to a [sales forecast](http://www.statista.com/statistics/272595/global-shipments-forecast-for-tablets-laptops-and-desktop-pcs/) published in 2016 for tablets, laptops and desktop PCs worldwide from Statista, laptop sales sales were predicted to increase last year and this year before moving back to a six-year cyclical cycle. The forecast indicates that mobile devices moving toward a cyclical industry by next year as the market is beginning to saturate.
To put some context to the story, the author of “How Long Will Desktop Linux Last?” claims that mobile and business interests are going to close out the need for PC and Linux-based PC projects because developers could be pressured to stop working on what home users want for what businesses want. 

This is a little hard to believe seeing that users worldwide want both and white-collar workers require both.

Mobile is good for functionality, but the PC offers what mobile doesn’t. Practicality. 

Mobile will not cannibalize the PC nor vice versa. 
Linux projects that focus on both like Ubuntu or those like openSUSE that gravitate toward the PC will continue to evolve for those who want it or need it.
